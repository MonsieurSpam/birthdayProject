#birthdayProject

Hi! I'm Alex and I'm just learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is my first project that I made on my birthday which is a site that plays birthday songs for you if you're lonely and don't have anybody to sing the song to you. I know I'm still really inexperienced with all of this so there's a lot of stuff that doesn't really work well such as the image carousel and the responsiveness of the pages.
